    Fantagraphics originals
    Minor fixes (before or after upscayl?)
    Convert all Fantagraphics to 4x Upscayls (approx 25 x 7GB = 175GB)
    Using 4x Upscayls:
        Remove jpeg artifacts
        Remove colors
        Smooth removed colors black ink
        Generate svg
        Inpaint images with removed colors black ink removed
        Overlay inpainted image with svg black ink
        Resize to target restored size
        Save resized svg or just use svg as B/W option

        Maybe:
            Add jpg comments to saved files (upscayl, restored and svg)
            Layer color (switch in mcomix) or segment color
